# ðŸš€ Hetzner DDNS Agent

This program allows to use Hetzner DNS as a DynDNS service. It does that by updating a defined record inside a DNS zone
to the current public IPv4 address.

To minimize API calls to the Hetzner API, it'll check if the IP is different from the previous IP. It *cannot* detect if
the IP has changed on Hetzners side to update accordingly. The update will only be triggered on start or when the public
IP changed.

It uses the [public-ip](https://github.com/sindresorhus/public-ip) package
by [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) to retrieve the current public IPv4.
