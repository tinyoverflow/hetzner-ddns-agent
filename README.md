# ðŸš€ Hetzner DDNS Agent

This program allows to use [Hetzner DNS](https://www.hetzner.com/dns-console) as
a [DDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) service. It does that by updating a given record inside a DNS zone
to the current public IPv4 address.

To minimize API calls to the Hetzner API, it'll check if the IP is different from the previous IP. It *cannot* detect if
the IP has changed on Hetzners side to update accordingly. The update will only be triggered on start or when the public
IP changed.

It uses the [public-ip](https://github.com/sindresorhus/public-ip) package
by [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) to retrieve the current public IPv4.

## Usage

This service is available as a Docker image, so you can get up and running in just a minute. The image is available
at `ghcr.io/tinyoverflow/hetzner-ddns-agent:v1.1.0`. While this container does not require any additional dependencies
or port mappings, it requires the configuration of some environment variables to work properly.
