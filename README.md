# ðŸš€ Hetzner DDNS Agent

This program allows to use [Hetzner DNS](https://www.hetzner.com/dns-console) as
a [DDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) service. It does that by updating a given record inside a DNS zone
to the current public IPv4 address.

To minimize API calls to the Hetzner API, it'll check if the IP is different from the previous IP. It *cannot* detect if
the IP has changed on Hetzners side to update accordingly. The update will only be triggered on start or when the public
IP changed.

It uses the [public-ip](https://github.com/sindresorhus/public-ip) package
by [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) to retrieve the current public IPv4.

## Usage

This service is available as a Docker image, so you can get up and running in just a minute. The image is available
at `ghcr.io/tinyoverflow/hetzner-ddns-agent:v1.1.0`. While this container does not require any additional dependencies
or port mappings, it requires the configuration of some environment variables to work properly.

### Environment variables

| Variable    | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                                                              |
|-------------|--------|----------|:--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API_TOKEN   | string | Yes      | -       | You can create an API token in your [Hetzner DNS Console](https://dns.hetzner.com/settings/api-token).   |
| ZONE_ID     | string | Yes      | -       | ID of the zone in which your record is located.                                                          |
| RECORD_ID   | string | Yes      | -       | ID of the record to keep updated.                                                                        |
| RECORD_NAME | string | No       | `@`     | Name of the record. This is basically the subdomain, or `@` if you want to use the domain itself.        |
| RECORD_TTL  | int    | No       | `300`   | TTL of the record in seconds. It defines how long the entry should be cached by DNS servers and clients. |
